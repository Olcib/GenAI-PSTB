    "‚Ä¢ It should take two parameters: animal_type and count (with a default value of 1). Count is the quantity of the animal that will be added to the animal dictionary.\n",
    "The dictionary will look like this:\n",
    "{'cow': 1, 'pig':3, 'horse': 2}\n",
    "‚Ä¢ If the animal_type already exists in the animals dictionary, increment its count by count.\n",
    "‚Ä¢ If it doesn‚Äôt exist, add it to the dictionary as the key and with the given count as value."
